# React + Vite Expense Tracker App

This project will help me solve real-world problems by helping a user to track their expenses. This is important to me as I love to organise my money and spend conscientiously. I am very invested in finances so this is a natural project for me to undertake to learn more about programming whilst benefitting my other goals. 

The web app will start very simple and from there on I will try to make it more eloquent and complex throughout the weeks and months when I pick it up from time to time between my other projects and work.
